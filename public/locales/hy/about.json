  "history-description": "Gyumri, Armenia’s second-largest city, is a centuries-old cultural hub.  Armenians have populated this ancient city since the 5th century B.C.  In modern times, Gyumri has been known for its arts, manufacturing and craftsmanship.  \nThe city was badly devastated by a crippling earthquake in 1988, which killed between 25,000 – 50,000 and injured over 100,000 people.  Although it had many important institutions of higher learning, the earthquake and the changes in Armenia’s economy following its independence from the Soviet Union in 1989, left few opportunities for local employment and forced many young people to emigrate to Yerevan and abroad. \nA group of young, diasporan professionals, visiting the region through the Fund for Armenian Relief (FAR), conceived the potential to drive positive economic outcomes through technology, and conceptualized an educational program with a focus on computer programming and engineering. \nThe Gyumri IT Center (GITC) was created in 2005 to provide educational opportunities for local students interested in computer programming, design, science and math.  The goal of GITC is to leverage technology education to provide long-term employment opportunities in the region. \nMost GITC students are post-graduates who are looking to advance their engineering and computer programming skills en route to a full-time career.\n",
